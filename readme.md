# Code for CTEC3905 02 lab

This is the simplest solution to the exercise set in the second lab.

If you uncomment the CSS between lines 42 and 53, this will:

- override the CSS rules above
- set the `nav` to the left
- resize the `main` and `nav` widths
- arrange the `main` and `nav` horizontally beneath the header
